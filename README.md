## Introduction
**StringNET** is a **neural network**–based method for computing transition pathways between metastable states. Our approach is built on a **variational formulation** over curves in the path space and can be used to compute the **Maximum Flux Path (MFP)**, **Minimum Energy Path (MEP)**, and **Minimum Action Path (MAP)**.

Our code is accompanied by a set of **well-organized numerical examples** that clearly demonstrate the method on various test cases, including:
- **Double-Well and Three-Well Potentials**
- **Alanine Dipeptide Conformational Transitions**
- **High-Dimensional Muller Potential**
- **2D and 4D Ginzburg–Landau Functionals**
